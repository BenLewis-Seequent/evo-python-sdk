# Download Pointset Data from Seequent Evo

This notebook demonstrates how to download pointset data from your Seequent Evo workspace and view it as a pandas DataFrame.

In this example, we'll download the pointset "Ag_LMS1 - Ag_ppm Values" from the workspace.

## Requirements

You must have a Seequent account with Evo entitlement to use this notebook.

You will need:
- The client ID of your Evo application

To obtain these app credentials, refer to the [Apps and tokens guide](https://developer.seequent.com/docs/guides/getting-started/apps-and-tokens) in the Seequent Developer Portal.

#%% md
## Step 1: Authentication

First, let's authenticate with Seequent Evo using your client ID.

#%%
from evo.notebooks import ServiceManagerWidget

# Evo app credentials
client_id = "<your-client-id>"  # Replace with your client ID

manager = await ServiceManagerWidget.with_auth_code(
    client_id=client_id,
    discovery_url="https://discover.api.seequent.com",
    cache_location="./notebook-data",
).login()

#%% md
## Step 2: Search for the Pointset

Use the search widget to find the pointset "Ag_LMS1 - Ag_ppm Values" in your workspace.

The widget allows you to:
- Search by partial name
- Filter by object type
- View metadata about the selected object

#%%
from evo.notebooks import ObjectSearchWidget

# Search for the pointset
picker = ObjectSearchWidget(manager, search="Ag_LMS1", object_type="pointset")

#%% md
## Step 3: Load the Pointset

Now we'll load the selected pointset using the typed `PointSet` class.

#%%
from evo.objects.typed import PointSet

# Load the pointset from the selected reference
pointset = await PointSet.from_reference(manager, picker.selected_reference)

print(f"Loaded pointset: {pointset.name}")

#%% md
## Step 4: Display Links to Evo

Display convenient links to view the pointset in Evo Viewer and Portal.

#%%
from evo.notebooks import display_object_links

# Show clickable links to open in Evo Viewer and Portal
display_object_links(pointset, label="Ag_LMS1 - Ag_ppm Values")

#%% md
## Step 5: View Data as DataFrame

Get the pointset data as a pandas DataFrame to explore and analyze.

#%%
# Get all locations and attributes as a DataFrame
df = await pointset.locations.as_dataframe()

# Display the first few rows
print(f"Downloaded {len(df)} points")
df.head()

#%% md
## Additional Operations

You can also access specific attributes or explore the pointset structure.

#%%
# List all available attributes
print("Available attributes:")
for attr in pointset.locations.attributes:
    print(f"  - {attr.name}: {attr.attribute_type}")

# Access the full DataFrame for further analysis
print(f"\nDataFrame shape: {df.shape}")
print(f"Columns: {list(df.columns)}")

#%% md
## Summary

In this notebook, we've completed the following:
1. Authenticated with Seequent Evo
2. Searched for and selected the "Ag_LMS1 - Ag_ppm Values" pointset
3. Loaded the pointset as a typed object
4. Displayed links to view the object in Evo
5. Retrieved the data as a pandas DataFrame

You can now use the DataFrame `df` for any further analysis or visualization!
