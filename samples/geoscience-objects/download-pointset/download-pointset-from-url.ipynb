# Download Pointset Data from Seequent Evo

This notebook demonstrates how to download pointset data from a Seequent Evo workspace and view it as a pandas DataFrame.

In this example, we download the pointset "Ag_LMS1 - Ag_ppm Values" from the integration environment.

## Requirements

You must have a Seequent account with the Evo entitlement to use this notebook.

The following parameters must be provided:

- The client ID of your Evo application.

To obtain these app credentials, refer to the [Apps and tokens guide](https://developer.seequent.com/docs/guides/getting-started/apps-and-tokens) in the Seequent Developer Portal.

#%%
from evo.notebooks import ServiceManagerWidget

client_id = "<your-client-id>"  # Replace with your client ID

# Integration environment (evo.integration.seequent.com)
# For production (evo.seequent.com), omit base_uri and discovery_url parameters
manager = await ServiceManagerWidget.with_auth_code(
    client_id=client_id,
    base_uri="https://qa-ims.bentley.com",  # Integration environment IMS
    discovery_url="https://int-discover.test.api.seequent.com",  # Integration discovery URL
    cache_location="./notebook-data",
).login()

## Load the Pointset

We'll load the pointset directly using its object ID from the Evo Portal URL.

**Note:** This example uses a specific object from a test workspace in the integration environment. Replace the `object_id` below with the ID from your own workspace URL (found in the `?id=` parameter of your Evo Portal URL).

Example source URL format: `https://evo.integration.seequent.com/{org_id}/workspaces/{hub_code}/{workspace_id}/overview?id={object_id}`

#%%
from evo.objects import ObjectReference
from evo.objects.typed import PointSet
from evo.notebooks import display_object_links

# Build object reference from URL components
# Object ID extracted from the ?id= parameter in the Evo Portal URL
# Replace this with your own object ID from your workspace
object_id = "9100d7dc-44e9-4e61-b427-159635dea22f"  # Example: "Ag_LMS1 - Ag_ppm Values" pointset

environment = manager.get_environment()
prefix = f"{environment.hub_url}geoscience-object/orgs/{environment.org_id}/workspaces/{environment.workspace_id}/objects"
object_reference = ObjectReference(f"{prefix}/{object_id}")

# Download the pointset
pointset = await PointSet.from_reference(manager, object_reference)

display_object_links(pointset)
print(f"Downloaded: {pointset.name}")

## View Data as DataFrame

Get all locations and attributes as a pandas DataFrame.

# Get all locations and attributes as a DataFrame
df = await pointset.locations.as_dataframe()
df.head()

## Summary

In this example, we've completed the following:

* Authenticated to the Evo integration environment
* Built an ObjectReference from the object ID in the Evo Portal URL
* Downloaded the pointset "Ag_LMS1 - Ag_ppm Values" using typed objects
* Viewed the data as a pandas DataFrame

The DataFrame contains the 3D coordinates (x, y, z) and all attributes from the pointset.
